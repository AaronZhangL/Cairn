 * Why this exists next to `runJob` instead of inside it: runJob's queue is a
 * fixed array walked by a cursor, which is exactly right for a batch run and
 * exactly wrong for a reader who jumps to station 10. Making that queue
 * re-orderable would put interactive concerns inside the one piece of the
 * pipeline that everything else depends on.
 *
 * So the two coexist. They share the JobStore, and the store is consulted
 * before every build, so a book half-built by the CLI resumes here and vice
 * versa. `runJob` stays the batch path; this is the interactive one.
 *
 * The reader sees the path the moment `reduce` finishes and starts walking
 * while the rest is still being built — which is the whole point, because the
 * decks are the long pole and the path is not.
